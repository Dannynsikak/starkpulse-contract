# StarkPulse Contract ⚡🔒

StarkPulse is a cutting-edge, decentralized crypto news aggregator and portfolio management platform built on the StarkNet ecosystem. This repository contains the smart contract code that powers the StarkPulse platform.

## Overview

The StarkPulse contract provides the backbone for secure user authentication, portfolio tracking, transaction monitoring, and decentralized data management. Built with Cairo, it leverages StarkNet's scalability and security to deliver a robust foundation for the StarkPulse ecosystem.

## Key Features

- **Secure User Authentication 🔐**: Robust user management with password hashing and session control
- **Portfolio Tracking System 📊**: Track and manage crypto assets with real-time updates
- **Transaction Monitoring 🔍**: Comprehensive transaction history and status tracking
- **Notification Management 📱**: Real-time alerts for important portfolio events
- **Access Control System 🛡️**: Fine-grained permissions and security controls
- **Contract Interaction Utilities 🔄**: Seamless integration with other StarkNet contracts

## Tech Stack

- **Cairo 2.x**: StarkNet's secure smart contract language
- **Scarb**: Package manager for Cairo projects
- **StarkNet**: Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Scarb](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/) - Cairo package manager
- [StarkNet CLI](https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/hello_starknet/index.html#installation) - For deploying contracts

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pulsefy/starkpulse-contract.git
cd starkpulse-contract
```

2. Build the contracts:

```bash
scarb build
```

3. Run tests:

```bash
scarb test
```

### Deployment

Use the deployment scripts in the `scripts/` directory:

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

## Simulation & Scenario Testing Utilities

The StarkPulse contract suite includes advanced simulation tools for pre-deployment testing and contract interaction analysis. These utilities are located in `contracts/src/simulation/` and provide:

- **Transaction Simulation:** Emulate contract calls and predict outcomes before actual execution.
- **State Manipulation:** Take and restore contract state snapshots, or set state for testing.
- **Scenario Orchestration:** Define and run sequences of contract interactions to validate complex workflows.
- **Result Analysis & Reporting:** Capture events, estimate gas, and generate detailed simulation reports.

### Usage Example

1. **Simulate a Transaction**

   - Use `simulate_transaction_full` from `transaction_simulator.cairo` to emulate a contract call and get a detailed report.

2. **Manipulate State**

   - Use `state_manipulator.cairo` to snapshot, restore, or set contract state for comprehensive scenario coverage.

3. **Run a Scenario**

   - Use `scenario_runner.cairo` to define a sequence of contract calls and analyze the results for all steps.

4. **View Reports**
   - Simulation reports include transaction results, events, and gas usage for easy debugging and optimization.

See the `contracts/src/simulation/` directory and test files for more detailed examples and integration patterns.
